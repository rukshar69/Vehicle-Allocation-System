Here’s the README file with clear instructions on how to run, deploy, and maintain your project:

# Vehicle Allocation System - FastAPI with MongoDB

This project implements a **vehicle allocation system** using **FastAPI** and **MongoDB**. The application allows employees to allocate vehicles for a day, ensuring that no vehicle is double-booked on the same date. A **driver is pre-assigned** to each vehicle, and employees can **create, update, or delete allocations** before the allocation date. 

The project is fully **containerized with Docker**. 

## **Project Structure**
```
/app
│   ├── main.py            # FastAPI application entry point
│   ├── models.py          # Pydantic schema models
│   ├── crud.py            # CRUD operations for vehicle allocation
│   ├── database.py          # Establish MongoDB connection
│   ├── requirements.txt   # Python dependencies
│   ├── Dockerfile                 # Docker configuration for FastAPI
/docker-compose.yml         # Docker Compose configuration
```

---

## **Prerequisites**
- Install **Docker Desktop** on your machine.
- Ensure that **ports 8000** (FastAPI) and **27017** (MongoDB) are available.

## **Running the Project**

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Build and Start the Containers**  
   Use Docker Compose to build the images and start the services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. **Access the Application**
   - API Documentation (Swagger UI): [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

## **How to Deploy the Project**
### 1. **Production Deployment Steps**
- Use **Gunicorn** instead of Uvicorn for production:
  ```bash
  CMD ["gunicorn", "main:app", "-w", "4", "-k", "uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8000"]
  ```
- Setup **MongoDB Atlas** for a managed MongoDB cluster.
- Use **NGINX as a reverse proxy** to serve the application.


### 2. **Environment Variables**
Store sensitive information (e.g., database credentials) in a `.env` file and load them in your application.


---

## **Maintenance Guidelines**
- **Monitoring**: Use **Prometheus** and **Grafana** to monitor container performance and API response times.
- **Logging**: Centralize logs using tools like **ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** stack.
- **Backups**: Automate MongoDB backups using **mongodump**.
- **Security**: 
  - Implement **rate limiting** to prevent abuse.
  - Regularly update Docker images and dependencies.

---

## **How to Stop the Application**
To stop the running containers:
```bash
docker-compose down
```
